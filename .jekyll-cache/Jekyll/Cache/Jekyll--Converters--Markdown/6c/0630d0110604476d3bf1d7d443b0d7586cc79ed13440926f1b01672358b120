I"q<p>There are so many apps for online journals but only few offer a community. Although, writing a journal already has a tone of keeping it secret, it is still nice to have an option to share your journal with your family, friends, or someone you donâ€™t know. There are 4 online journals I found that offer  community where you can share your journals with others.</p>
