I".<p>I recently found this app called Jour on the App store and decided to try it out to see if I like it or not. 
First impression, the app is visually enjoyable and subtle animation creates a feeling of well designed and built all over all. I like an onboarding flow that does not require sign up or sign in as mandatory and being able to explore the features of the app flawlessly. Tapping through the onboarding flow that led me to write a journal, I got the idea of how this app works within 5 mins or less. The app asks you how I feel followed by some other questions based on what you select and guide you what to write. It seems to be a good user flow if you donâ€™t know what to write or looking for some guide to start your journal from but also can be annoying if you just want to free write.<p>
