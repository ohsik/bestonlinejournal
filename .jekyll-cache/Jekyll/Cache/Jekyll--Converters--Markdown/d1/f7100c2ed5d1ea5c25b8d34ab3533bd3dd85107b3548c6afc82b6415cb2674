I"ù<p>There are so many apps for online journals but only few offer a community. Although, writing a journal already has a tone of keeping it secret, it is still nice to have an option to share your journal with your family, friends, or someone you don‚Äôt know. There are 4 online journals I found that offer a community where you can share your journals with others and also keep it as a private for yourself.</p>
