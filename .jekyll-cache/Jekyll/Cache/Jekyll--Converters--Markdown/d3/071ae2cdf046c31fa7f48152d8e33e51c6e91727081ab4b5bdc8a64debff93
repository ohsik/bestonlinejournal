I"‘<p>There are so many apps for online journals but only few offer a community. Although, writing a journal already has a tone of keeping it secret, it is still nice to have an option to share your journal with your family, friends, or someone you donâ€™t know. Here are 4 online journals I found that offer community where you can share your journals with others and get connected with each other.</p>
