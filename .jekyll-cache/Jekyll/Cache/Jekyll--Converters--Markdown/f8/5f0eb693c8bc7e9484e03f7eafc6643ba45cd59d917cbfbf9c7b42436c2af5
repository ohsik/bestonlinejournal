I"ü<p>There are so many apps for online journals but only few offer a community. Although, writing a journal already has a tone of keeping it secret, it is still nice to have an option to share your journal with your family, friends, or someone you donâ€™t know. There are 4 online journals I found that offer a community where you can share your journals with others and also keep it as a private for yourself.</p>

<p>In this article, I will review 4 online journal apps that offer a community for journal writers.</p>

<h2>Goodnight Journal</h2>
<p>Private Journal: Yes
Community: Yes
Web:  Yes
iOS App: Yes
Android App: Yes</p>

<p>Goodnight Journal offers iOS, Android, and web apps that can be used on any device with the internet which make it a lot more accessible among others. You can write unlimited private journals with no advertisements and participate in the community with either monthly or annual membership. Goodnight Journalâ€™s community is built on paid membership which makes the quality much higher than other online journal communities.</p>

<p>Open Diary
Private Journal: Yes
Community: Yes
Web:  Yes
iOS App: No
Android App: No</p>

<p>Another online journal community you can use for free. Open Diary was big when it was launched in the 90s but was shut down for a while. However, it still has a bunch of users from the 90s and offers an active online journal community.</p>

<p>Open Diary can be used on the devices with a web browser but doesnâ€™t offer mobile apps. With the paid membership, you wonâ€™t have to wait 30 minutes to publish your journal after writing it.</p>

<p>My Diary
Private Journal: Yes
Community: Yes
Web:  Yes
iOS App: No
Android App: No</p>

<p>One of the OG of the online journal communities where you can write public journals and private journals for free. However, thereâ€™s not much interaction betweens the users since thereâ€™s no commenting or like feature built in. You can use it free on the web but no mobile apps are offered.</p>

<p>ProseBox
Private Journal: Yes
Community: Yes
Web:  Yes
iOS App: No
Android App: No</p>

<p>Another good online journal community with users migrated from Open Diary when they shut down the service. Free to use with suggested donation on the web with some advertisements. No mobile apps are offered.</p>
