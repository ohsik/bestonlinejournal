title: 4 best online journal communities for 2021
---

<p>There are so many apps for online journals but only few offer a community. Although, writing a journal already has a tone of keeping it secret, it is still nice to have an option to share your journal with your family, friends, or someone you don’t know. Here are 4 online journals I found that offer community where you can share your journals with others and get connected with each other.</p>

<p>In this article, I will review 4 online journal apps that offer a community for journal writers.</p>

<h2>Goodnight Journal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Private Journal: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Community: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Web:  Yes ✅</li>
  <li>iOS App: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Android App: Yes ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Goodnight Journal offers iOS, Android, and web apps that can be used on any device with the internet which make it a lot more accessible among others. You can write unlimited private journals with no advertisements and participate in the community with either monthly or annual membership. Goodnight Journal’s community is built on paid membership which makes the quality much higher than other online journal communities.</p>

<h2>Open Diary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Private Journal: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Community: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Web:  Yes ✅</li>
  <li>iOS App: No ❌</li>
  <li>Android App: No ❌</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the oldest online journal communities that you can use for free. Open Diary was big when it was launched in the 90s but was shut down for a while. However, it still has a bunch of users from the 90s and offers an active online journal community.</p>

<p>Open Diary can be used on the devices with a web browser but doesn’t offer mobile apps. With the paid membership, you won’t have to wait 30 minutes to publish your journal after writing it.</p>

<h2>My Diary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Private Journal: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Community: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Web:  Yes ✅</li>
  <li>iOS App: No ❌</li>
  <li>Android App: No ❌</li>
</ul>
<p>Another OG of the online journal communities where you can write public journals and private journals for free. However, there’s not much interaction betweens the users since there’s no commenting or like feature built in. You can use it free on the web but no mobile apps are offered.</p>

<h2>ProseBox</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Private Journal: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Community: Yes ✅</li>
  <li>Web:  Yes ✅</li>
  <li>iOS App: No ❌</li>
  <li>Android App: No ❌</li>
</ul>
<p>ProseBox is a good online journal community with users migrated from Open Diary when they shut down the service. Free to use with suggested donation on the web with some advertisements. No mobile apps are offered.</p>

<h2>What’s your pick for your online journal community?</h2>
<p>These are the 4 most active online journal communities where you can write journals and get connected with other journal writers. After going over all 4 of them, I noticed that most of them feel very outdated that were designed a long time ago and haven’t been updated since then except Goodnight Journal.</p>

<p>Goodnight Journal is the only online journal app with the community with the modern design and actively updated with extra features to keep you healthy mentally along with writing journals online.</p>
